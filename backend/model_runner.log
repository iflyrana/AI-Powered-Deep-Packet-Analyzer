/home/pi/aipktanalyser/backend/model_runner.py:112: UserWarning: [16:24:24] WARNING: /workspace/src/collective/../data/../common/error_msg.h:82: If you are loading a serialized model (like pickle in Python, RDS in R) or
configuration generated by an older version of XGBoost, please export the model by calling
`Booster.save_model` from that version first, then load it back in current version. See:

    https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/saving_model.html

for more details about differences between saving model and serializing.

  xgboost_model = pickle.load(open('xgboost_on_cicidsunswbinary.pkl', 'rb'))
